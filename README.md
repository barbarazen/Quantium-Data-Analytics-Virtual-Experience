# Quantium-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Experience

This repository contains my solution for both task 1 and task 2 of the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program.

Quantium has had a data partnership with a large supermarket brand for the last few years who provide transactional and customer data. You are an analyst within the Quantium analytics team and are responsible for delivering highly valued data analytics and insights to help the business make strategic decisions.

You are part of Quantium’s retail analytics team and have been approached by your client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.

# Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics

    Examine transaction data – look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. 

    Examine customer data – check for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls and when you are happy merge the transaction and customer data together so it’s ready for the analysis ensuring you save your files along the way.

    Data analysis and customer segments –  define the metrics – look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find. These will all form part of our report to Julia. 

    Deep dive into customer segments – define your recommendation from your insights, determine which segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on your analysis. 
    
# Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing

For this part of the project, we will be examining the performance in trial vs control stores to provide a recommendation for each location based on our insight.

    Select control stores – explore the data and define metrics for the control store and   selection – think about what would make them a control store. 

    Assessment of the trial – Acquire interesting insights into each of the stores, check  each trial store individually in comparison with the control store to get a clear view  of its overall performance. We want to know if the trial stores were successful or not. 

    Collate findings –  summarise findings for each store and provide a recommendation     outlining the impact on sales during the trial period.
